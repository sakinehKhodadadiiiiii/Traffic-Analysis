# Traffic-Analysis
In this project, I will be exploring the dataset of four junctions and built a model to analyse traffic on the same. This could potentially help in solving the traffic congestion problem by providing a better understanding of traffic patterns that will further help in building an infrastructure to eliminate the problem.
